// Say there was a function that took 1 second to execute and you needed to run this function 10 million times,
//how would you cut down on the execution time?

// One way to cut down on the execution time of a function that needs to be run many times is to use parallel processing or multithreading. This involves splitting up the work into multiple smaller tasks that can be executed simultaneously on different processor cores or threads.

// For example, suppose you have a function that takes 1 second to execute and you need to run it 10 million times. Instead of running the function 10 million times sequentially,
// you could split up the work into 10 smaller tasks, each consisting of 1 million function calls. 
//Then, you could execute each task on a separate thread or processor core, allowing multiple function calls to be executed simultaneously.

// Another approach is to optimize the function itself to make it run faster. This could involve:

// Streamlining the algorithm to reduce the number of operations or iterations needed.
// Caching or memoizing results to avoid redundant calculations.
// Using more efficient data structures or algorithms to improve performance.
// Refactoring the code to take advantage of parallel processing or multithreading.
// Optimizing the function itself can be more challenging than parallelizing the workload, but it can potentially lead to even greater performance gains.

// Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand. 
//Parallel processing and function optimization are just two of many possible strategies for improving the performance of a function that needs to be run many times.
